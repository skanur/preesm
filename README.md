Data-parallel Plugin
=====

Plugin to determine if a given Synchronous Dataflow Graph (SDFG) is data-parallel i.e the SDFG can be scheduled in such a way that each actor can fire all of its instances when the actor is ready to be executed. 

The work is part of PREESM toolchain.

## PREESM

PREESM (the Parallel and Real-time Embedded Executives Scheduling Method) is an open source rapid prototyping and code generation tool. It is primarily employed to simulate signal processing applications and generate code for multi-core Digital Signal Processors.
